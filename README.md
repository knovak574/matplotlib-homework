In analyzing all of the data for this project and using various plotting/visualizations a number of observations could be made.
I would note the following:
  1. Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest average tumor volumes amonst the four treatment regimens by a significant margin.  Perhaps coincidenatlly, they had the largest number of measurments as well.
  2. Capomulin seems to be effective in shrinking tumor volumes over time, I picked one sample mouse and charted out a significantly downward sloping chart showing the effectiveness.
  3. There is a high correlation between mouse weight and tumor size in the sample mice measured.  Heavier mice had bigger tumors with a very strong correlation (near 1).
